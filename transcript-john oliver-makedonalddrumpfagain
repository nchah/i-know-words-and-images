<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="3.78" dur="5.63">our main story tonight and I cannot
believe I&amp;#39;m saying this is Donald Trump</text><text start="9.41" dur="4.99">and I say that I say that knowing that
every time his name he said out loud he</text><text start="14.4" dur="7.26">has a shattering orgasm we have mostly
ignored Trump on the show but he has now</text><text start="21.66" dur="3.73">won three states has been endorsed by
chris Christie and Paul showed him</text><text start="25.39" dur="5.66">leading most Super Tuesday States which
is a big deal since 1988 every candidate</text><text start="31.05" dur="3.98">has won the most states on Super Tuesday
went on to become their party&amp;#39;s nominee</text><text start="35.03" dur="5.04">so at this point donald Trump is
america&amp;#39;s back mull it may have seemed</text><text start="40.07" dur="4.579">harmless a year ago but now that he&amp;#39;s
gotten frighteningly bigger it is no</text><text start="44.649" dur="5.1">longer wise to ignore it and I do
understand what Trump supported might</text><text start="49.749" dur="2.34">like him he&amp;#39;s unpredictable and
entertaining</text><text start="52.089" dur="4.711">just look how he went off to Marco Rubio
on Friday did you ever see against what</text><text start="56.8" dur="17.68">like this bitch Rubio</text><text start="74.48" dur="5.36">just as it was funny when I would like
to extend my best wishes to all even the</text><text start="79.84" dur="5.86">haters and losses on this special date
september 11 he wished haters and loses</text><text start="85.7" dur="5.68">a happy 911 there was a part of me to
even likes this guy it&amp;#39;s a part of me I</text><text start="91.38" dur="5.23">hate God it is a part of me and if you
are someone who sick of the party</text><text start="96.61" dur="3.16">establishment he might seem like a
protest candidate with some attractive</text><text start="99.77" dur="3.56">qualities we like him about it like it
is</text><text start="103.33" dur="4.89">he says what he means by I honestly
believe he&amp;#39;s telling the truth campaign</text><text start="108.22" dur="8.88">nobody told him I think he&amp;#39;s a credible
businessman yes he runs the country like</text><text start="117.1" dur="3.83">he runs his organization we will be in
good shape</text><text start="120.93" dur="5.7">donald Trump can seem appealing until
you take a closer look much like the</text><text start="126.63" dur="2.45">lunch buffet at a strip club</text><text start="129.08" dur="3.83">the NFL or having a pet chimpanzee</text><text start="132.91" dur="6.27">it seems fun but someday koko&amp;#39;s gonna
tell you can enjoy because let&amp;#39;s look at</text><text start="139.18" dur="4.98">each of those qualities those people
listed first he tells it like it is does</text><text start="144.16" dur="4.25">he because the website PolitiFact check
77 of these statements and rated</text><text start="148.41" dur="4.96">seventy-six percent of them as varying
degrees of false I&amp;#39;ve witnessed this</text><text start="153.37" dur="4.26">firsthand you want to talk to my old
boss by tweeting if Jon Stewart is all</text><text start="157.63" dur="4.12">above it all and legit why did he change
his name from Jonathan lebowitz he</text><text start="161.75" dur="4.88">should be proud of his heritage and then
two years later I never attacks dopey</text><text start="166.63" dur="3.64">Jon Stewart but his family last night
would never do that</text><text start="170.27" dur="4.73">and then just last year he claimed
falsely to turn down an invite to appear</text><text start="175" dur="6.09">on this very boring shop and do see
trying to impress with that large show&amp;#39;s</text><text start="181.09" dur="7.92">guests include schloss and poppies a
petting zoo with a desk when we pointed</text><text start="189.01" dur="4.22">out that he had never been invited this
is how he responded all of a sudden she</text><text start="193.23" dur="4.36">people saying that John Oliver in Saint
John Oliver and I checked with my people</text><text start="197.59" dur="5.01">PSU to be on the show four or five times
and I i dont even hardly know who was I</text><text start="202.6" dur="4.05">wouldn&amp;#39;t know what he looks like what
look first I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect him to know</text><text start="206.65" dur="3.77">who won for his inevitable angry tweets
about this segment all telling what I</text><text start="210.42" dur="4.6">look like a look like an associate
pirate who works at a bank</text><text start="215.02" dur="5.87">secondly secondly was genuinely
destabilizing to be on the receiving end</text><text start="220.89" dur="5.49">of that confident I even checked to make
sure that no one even accidentally</text><text start="226.38" dur="5.9">invited him and of course they had and
I&amp;#39;m not even sure he knows he&amp;#39;s lying I</text><text start="232.28" dur="4.54">think he just doesn&amp;#39;t care about what
the truth is donald Trump use the truth</text><text start="236.82" dur="4.79">like this lema views the supreme court
vacancy I don&amp;#39;t care about that in any</text><text start="241.61" dur="9.45">way please call for a ban on selling
point that he is truly independent and</text><text start="251.06" dur="4.44">not beholden to anyone or as he puts it
self funding my campaign I tell the</text><text start="255.5" dur="0.58">truth</text><text start="256.08" dur="6.37">probably twenty twenty-five million
dollars okay let&amp;#39;s break that down first</text><text start="262.45" dur="4.57">on rich therefore I tell the truth has
the same internal logic hers I&amp;#39;m a vegan</text><text start="267.02" dur="5.4">therefore I know karate no cause and
effect between those two and the</text><text start="272.42" dur="2.73">correlation usually goes the other way</text><text start="275.15" dur="4.06">and while it is true that he hasn&amp;#39;t
taken corporate money the implication</text><text start="279.21" dur="4.03">that he has personally spent twenty to
twenty-five million dollars is a bit of</text><text start="283.24" dur="5.1">a stretch because what he&amp;#39;s actually
done is loaned his own campaign 17 and a</text><text start="288.34" dur="4.57">half million dollars and is just
personally given just two hundred and</text><text start="292.91" dur="3.51">fifty thousand dollars and that&amp;#39;s
important because up until the</text><text start="296.42" dur="3.93">convention he can pay himself back the
loan with campaign funds and if you</text><text start="300.35" dur="3.05">don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s a significant
difference between a gift and alone</text><text start="303.4" dur="6.21">giving your spouse and anniversary loan
and see how and even he himself</text><text start="309.61" dur="5.15">sometimes admits that his campaign is by
no means completely self-funded I&amp;#39;m self</text><text start="314.76" dur="3.88">funding my camp other than the little
tiny ones where they send in a woman&amp;#39;s</text><text start="318.64" dur="3">sending we had a woman $7.59 what do you
do</text><text start="321.64" dur="4.07">how could you send the money back to you
know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s cute it&amp;#39;s beautiful they</text><text start="325.71" dur="4.96">feel invested in your campaign he makes
it sound like women are stopping grimy</text><text start="330.67" dur="4.13">dollar bills in analog writing donald
Trump on the front and he&amp;#39;s just too</text><text start="334.8" dur="4.93">kind to send them back but he&amp;#39;s taken in
seven and a half million dollars in</text><text start="339.73" dur="3.57">individual contributions and if he
didn&amp;#39;t want to maybe shouldn&amp;#39;t have had</text><text start="343.3" dur="5.98">to donate buttons on his website money
isn&amp;#39;t unsolicited when you have to ask</text><text start="349.28" dur="3.25">the someone&amp;#39;s credit card expiration
date to receive it</text><text start="352.53" dur="4.96">ok so so how about the claim that he is
tough well again I&amp;#39;m not sure about that</text><text start="357.49" dur="5.18">because for a tough guy he has
incredibly thin skin back in 1988 spy</text><text start="362.67" dur="4.87">magazine called him a short fingered
Bulgarian and ever since the editor</text><text start="367.54" dur="3.84">Graydon Carter says he received
envelopes from Trump always with a photo</text><text start="371.38" dur="3.62">on which he subtleties hand to highlight
the length of restricting</text><text start="375" dur="9.79">usually with a lunch meeting not so sure
he&amp;#39;s paying those same phone but the</text><text start="384.79" dur="4.6">very fact you some sensitive about them
is absolutely</text><text start="389.39" dur="5">as is the fact that those notes for
partly written in gold shopping which is</text><text start="394.39" dur="4.49">so quintessentially donald Trump
something that gives the appearance of</text><text start="398.88" dur="10.84">wealth but he&amp;#39;s actually just a cheap to
now trying to talk to or lawsuits he</text><text start="409.72" dur="4.73">loved to threaten to sue people like he
did with Rosie O&amp;#39;Donnell she said I was</text><text start="414.45" dur="4.65">bankrupt I never went bankrupt so
probably also her because it would be</text><text start="419.1" dur="6.69">fun I&amp;#39;d like to take some money out of
her fat ass pockets of course of course</text><text start="425.79" dur="3.55">he needs to take Rosie O&amp;#39;Donnell to
court to take money out of her pockets</text><text start="429.34" dur="9.66">because he&amp;#39;s tiny tiny fingers potential
to reach you in fact he&amp;#39;s repeatedly</text><text start="439" dur="2.59">threatened people and not followed
through</text><text start="441.59" dur="5.73">including the rapper Mac Miller lawrence
O&amp;#39;Donnell vanity fair and activists who</text><text start="447.32" dur="4.87">launched a petition for macy&amp;#39;s to drop
trumps products also you is trumps</text><text start="452.19" dur="4.81">version of bazinga it doesn&amp;#39;t really
mean anything but he says it all the</text><text start="457" dur="5.45">time but perhaps trumps biggest selling
point as a candidate easy success and</text><text start="462.45" dur="4.96">we&amp;#39;re good people get that idea from and
really rich I actually think I have the</text><text start="467.41" dur="3.1">best temperament table of me and you
know what I&amp;#39;ve been very successful</text><text start="470.51" dur="5.86">everybody loves me I went to an Ivy
League school I&amp;#39;m very highly-educated I</text><text start="476.37" dur="4.89">know words and the best words</text><text start="481.26" dur="13.05">in the sentence I have the best ones is
the word worse yet he has made more</text><text start="494.31" dur="2.08">money than most of us will make in a
lifetime</text><text start="496.39" dur="3.81">not only did he get a multi-million
dollar inheritance from his father but</text><text start="500.2" dur="5.5">he&amp;#39;s also lost a huge amount and this is
where we need to be careful because as</text><text start="505.7" dur="3.8">we&amp;#39;ve learned he will he will threaten
to sue your fat ass pockets with his</text><text start="509.5" dur="5.94">cocktail sausage fingers if you talk
about his company&amp;#39;s bankruptcy so all we</text><text start="515.44" dur="4.09">just let his own daughter described the
state of his finances at one point in</text><text start="519.53" dur="0.699">his life</text><text start="520.229" dur="4.891">my father and I were walking down fifth
Avenue and there is a homeless person</text><text start="525.12" dur="5.66">sitting sitting right outside of Trump
Tower and I remember my father pointing</text><text start="530.78" dur="4.98">to him and say you know that guy has a
billion dollars more than me because he</text><text start="535.76" dur="5.49">was a such extreme debt at that point
you know what really shows you the</text><text start="541.25" dur="4.5">indomitable spirit of Donald Trump to
fall to his lowest point and in that</text><text start="545.75" dur="7.6">very moment still find a way to be kind
of a dick to hold his campaign claims</text><text start="553.35" dur="3.72">his current work is in excess of ten
billion dollars and they&amp;#39;ve written it</text><text start="557.07" dur="5.19">in all caps so it must be true but
others disputed that figure in fact a</text><text start="562.26" dur="3.73">book once suggested the truck might be
worth a hundred and fifty to two hundred</text><text start="565.99" dur="4.85">and fifty million dollars which Trump
attested by suing the writer for five</text><text start="570.84" dur="1.56">billion dollars</text><text start="572.4" dur="4.04">which is a pretty roundabout way of
getting off the white 210 billion and</text><text start="576.44" dur="1.42">you should note for the record</text><text start="577.86" dur="5.27">trump lost that lawsuit twice but I am
glad that he suit if only because during</text><text start="583.13" dur="3.72">the deposition he explained that his
estimate of his net worth fluctuate</text><text start="586.85" dur="5.82">based on and I quote feelings even my
own feelings and that can change rapidly</text><text start="592.67" dur="4.89">from day-to-day think about that he
claimed that his net worth</text><text start="597.56" dur="5.23">changes depending on his mood which
makes absolutely no sex party because he</text><text start="602.79" dur="10.14">always seems to be in the same boot
specifically smog and a significant</text><text start="612.93" dur="6.95">portion is intangible is brand is what
he values very much and he was his</text><text start="619.88" dur="3.63">disclosure form that has released its
about three billion dollars that&amp;#39;s what</text><text start="623.51" dur="5.19">he values his branded exactly he
believes his own name three billion</text><text start="628.7" dur="5.18">dollars and I&amp;#39;m not saying a nine can&amp;#39;t
have value it&amp;#39;s why people pay $120 for</text><text start="633.88" dur="4.83">a plain white t-shirt that he&amp;#39;s designed
by Kanye West don&amp;#39;t want just anyone</text><text start="638.71" dur="9.27">teaching us that what one designed by
board sociopath with a finger 3-3 seems</text><text start="647.98" dur="5.63">especially because while Trump said if I
put my name on something you know it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="653.61" dur="4.67">gonna be good over the years his name
has been on some things that have been</text><text start="658.28" dur="5.27">very uncool including Trump shuttle
which no longer exists</text><text start="663.55" dur="4.15">vodka which was discontinued truck
magazine which folded trunk World</text><text start="667.7" dur="1.89">magazine which also folded</text><text start="669.59" dur="4.67">University of which is being sued and of
course the travel booking site go Trump</text><text start="674.26" dur="1.019">dot com</text><text start="675.279" dur="3.831">whose brief existence was imagined a
real thorn in the side of anyone hoping</text><text start="679.11" dur="1.979">got run the dot-com</text><text start="681.089" dur="7.211">single thing work masturbating and
that&amp;#39;s not even mentioning this becomes</text><text start="688.3" dur="4.889">too great steaks I&amp;#39;ve just raised the
stakes trumps takes on the world&amp;#39;s</text><text start="693.189" dur="4.46">greatest day and I mean that in every
sense of the word and the sharper image</text><text start="697.649" dur="8.511">is the only store where you can buy them
some states anymore but why did he sell</text><text start="706.16" dur="6.64">them up the shop but he&amp;#39;s only choice I
would like a massage chair an indoor</text><text start="712.8" dur="6.62">waterfall and a half pounds of the
finest meats in america every business</text><text start="719.42" dur="3.099">executive is bound to have a few
missteps but Trump&amp;#39;s lack of sound</text><text start="722.519" dur="4.031">financial instincts is perhaps best
exemplified by the business that he put</text><text start="726.55" dur="6.55">his name on back in 2006 just before the
entire housing market collapsed I think</text><text start="733.1" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s a great time to start a mortgage
company would have a great company</text><text start="736.43" dur="4.98">instruct mortgages mortgage dot com and
it&amp;#39;s going to be a terrific company yeah</text><text start="741.41" dur="6.909">it wasn&amp;#39;t in fact starting a mortgage
company in 2006 when the worst decisions</text><text start="748.319" dur="3.731">you could possibly might but I guess you
can convince yourself it was a good idea</text><text start="752.05" dur="5.159">when you say 30 words and thoughts of
them all great great terrific Trump and</text><text start="757.209" dur="1.75">Trump</text><text start="758.959" dur="5.591">site what nevermind site businesses what
he really use is a build a building with</text><text start="764.55" dur="4.229">Trump written on it is not necessarily
owned by him he may have just licensed</text><text start="768.779" dur="4.8">his name to them something he claims is
actually better than ownership you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="773.579" dur="2.601">put up money you don&amp;#39;t put up anything</text><text start="776.18" dur="6.389">spoken like a true builder and some of
those licensed buildings sell his</text><text start="782.569" dur="4.221">reputation hard like the sales video for
the Trump Ocean Resort in northern</text><text start="786.79" dur="5.159">Mexico I&amp;#39;m very very proud of the fact
that when I build I have investors that</text><text start="791.949" dur="0.751">follow me</text><text start="792.7" dur="4.6">all over people ask me what is Trump

it&amp;#39;s easy to throw around the word</text><text start="803.03" dur="5.68">quality of your estate and equality in

was never the build up for that project</text><text start="813.4" dur="3.35">which was later abandoned leaving
would-be condo buyers like William</text><text start="816.75" dur="6.36">flinch lost $168,000 feeling
understandably betrayed down trap was an</text><text start="823.11" dur="4.68">expert in in these types of projects or
so we thought it a deposition for a</text><text start="827.79" dur="1.96">lawsuit regarding the property</text><text start="829.75" dur="4.21">trump son Donald Trump junior conceded
that the Trump brand could lead people</text><text start="833.96" dur="4.6">to think of project was a solid
investment is one of the things that you</text><text start="838.56" dur="5.38">through this process is that the drug
name bring stability and our viability</text><text start="843.94" dur="5.14">of the project I don&amp;#39;t have to bring
stability or liability but imagine</text><text start="849.08" dur="6.31">certain people feel that might actually
be the most honest slogan for the trunk</text><text start="855.39" dur="5.17">campaign from 2016 I don&amp;#39;t know if it
brings stability or viability but im not</text><text start="860.56" dur="4.43">doin certain people feel</text><text start="864.99" dur="6.73">invested in that property sudan also did
in Trump Tower Tampa another project</text><text start="871.72" dur="2.51">that never got off the ground and in
both cases</text><text start="874.23" dur="4.53">characteristically deflected blame onto
the developers and you would think those</text><text start="878.76" dur="4.79">investors will be facing up in possible
legal battle given trumps tough talk</text><text start="883.55" dur="3.67">when I get sued I i take it right
autistic it all the way you know what</text><text start="887.22" dur="5.15">happens if you settle suits you get sued

cases the problem is even when you can</text><text start="898.62" dur="3.92">do most simply proved me wrong it&amp;#39;s
somehow never seems to matter you can</text><text start="902.54" dur="3.299">hold his feet to the fire but you&amp;#39;ll
just stand there on the stumps bragging</text><text start="905.839" dur="5.421">about his fireproof thoughts and but
maybe because he has spent decades</text><text start="911.26" dur="5.17">turning his own name into a brand
synonymous with success and quality and</text><text start="916.43" dur="4.37">he&amp;#39;s made himself the mascot for that
brands like Ronald McDonald or Chef</text><text start="920.8" dur="5.789">Boyardee and that is who we have seen in
the apprentice or WrestleMania or home</text><text start="926.589" dur="5.331">along too but he&amp;#39;s actually going to be
the republican nominee it&amp;#39;s time to stop</text><text start="931.92" dur="3.8">thinking of the mascot and start
thinking of the man is a candidate for</text><text start="935.72" dur="4.59">president needs a coherent set of
policies whatever you think about Marco</text><text start="940.31" dur="4.019">Rubio and Ted Cruz at least you&amp;#39;re
basically know where they stand but</text><text start="944.329" dur="4.341">Trump&amp;#39;s opinions have been wildly
inconsistent he&amp;#39;s been pro-choice and</text><text start="948.67" dur="5.37">pro-life for and against assault weapons
bans in favor of both bringing in Syrian</text><text start="954.04" dur="4.87">refugees and deporting them out of the
country and that inconsistency can be</text><text start="958.91" dur="3.669">troubling just this morning for instance
he was asked about the fact that david</text><text start="962.579" dur="4.971">duke former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan had told supporters to vote for him</text><text start="967.55" dur="4.07">and this was his answer will you
unequivocally condemn david you can say</text><text start="971.62" dur="3.48">that you don&amp;#39;t want his vote or that of
other white supremacist in this election</text><text start="975.1" dur="5.42">will just see you understand I don&amp;#39;t
know anything about david duke ok I</text><text start="980.52" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t know anything about what you&amp;#39;re
even talking about with white supremacy</text><text start="984.48" dur="3.62">or white supremacist honestly I don&amp;#39;t
know david duke I don&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="988.1" dur="1.91">ever met in my pretty sure I didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="990.01" dur="5.45">man I just don&amp;#39;t know anything about him
really that&amp;#39;s your best on Sat there</text><text start="995.46" dur="4.76">because you definitely know who he is
because you called him a bigot and a</text><text start="1000.22" dur="5.74">racist in the past but that&amp;#39;s not even
the key point the point is that you</text><text start="1005.96" dur="5.21">either racist or you are pretending to
be at some point there is no difference</text><text start="1011.17" dur="4.22">there and sure he disavowed by vjooq
